        This code has been developed by a group of CSULB students working on their 
        Computer Science senior project called Tutors4You.

        Tutors4You is a web application that students can utilize to find a tutor and
        ask them to meet at any location of their choosing. Students that struggle to understand 
        the courses they are taking would benefit from this peer to peer tutoring service.

                    The Tutors4You Web Application was the first step into full stack
            development for the members of this team. It was a challenging step forward,
            but we were able to accomplish it. We worked with the Agile methodology and had 
            followed the software development lifecycle to complete this product.We had worked with a plethora of
            technologies. For this web application, we used the JavaEE framework, developing in JSF for the front
            end and JPA for the back end. In order to deploy this web application,
            we utilized the Tomcat Server and Amazon Web Services. To store all the data on the backend,
            we used the AWS RDS/MySQL. We integrated the PayPal API and the ZipCode API. The PayPal API
            was used to handle the transaction between students and tutors. The ZipCode API was used
            for students to find students closest to them.
